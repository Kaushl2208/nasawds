The [NASA Glenn Web Design System](https://bruffridge.github.io/nasawds-site) includes a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for NASA websites. It is a fork of the [U.S. Web Design System](https://github.com/uswds/uswds).

This repository is for the Design System itself. NASA maintains [another repository for the documentation and website](https://github.com/bruffridge/nasawds-site).
